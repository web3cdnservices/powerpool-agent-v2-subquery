# SubQuery - PowerPool v2


## Run your project


1.  `yarn codegen` - Generates types from the GraphQL schema definition and contract ABIs and saves them in the `/src/types` directory. This must be done after each change to the `schema.graphql` file or the contract ABIs
2.  `yarn build` - Builds and packages the SubQuery project into the `/dist` directory
3.  `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up` - Runs a Docker container with an indexer, PostgeSQL DB, and a query service. This requires [Docker to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and running locally. The configuration for this container is set from your `docker-compose.yml`
